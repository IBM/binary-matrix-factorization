Random datasets

Datasets used in Table 2 and Figure 2 of the paper: random_type1/*_f2_*.csv
Datasets used in Table 3 and Figure 3 of the paper: random_type1/*_f5_*.csv
Datasets used in Table 4 and Figure 4 of the paper: random_type2/*_ones30_*.csv
Datasets used in Table 5 and Figure 5 of the paper: random_type2/*_ones50_*.csv

Real World datasets (datasets used in Table 6 and Figure 6 of the paper)

These datasets were downlowaded from online repositories.
In all cases, the files downloaded had to be modified to
fit the specifications of the input files used by our code.
In addition, some of the data in some of the datasets was
removed or adapted. Below, we include small descriptions of
those modifications.

The real world datasets are:

Amazon Political Books (APB) obtained from http://moreno.ss.uci.edu/data.html

CelebA (C) obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset/version/2
In our experiments we used only the first 1000 rows of the dataset.

Collaboration in Jazz (CiJ) obtained from http://moreno.ss.uci.edu/data.html

Primary Tumor (PT) obtained from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/primary+tumor
In this dataset, all but four of the features are
binary. Those that are not binary have several discrete options. They
were converted to binary by adding 
columns where each column is a binary variable indicating if that
option is selected or not. 

SPECT Heart (SH) obtained from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spect+heart

Voting Records (VR) obtained from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/congressional+voting+records
Each row of this dataset represents a congressman and each
column represents a bill that was put up for a vote.
Each vote has
three possible outcomes (yes, no, or unknown) and we transformed the
data by replacing each column with two binary columns. If the vote is
unknown, the two columns will have a zero. Otherwise, one column will
have a one and the other will have either a one or a zero depending on
whether the vote was yes or no, respectively.
